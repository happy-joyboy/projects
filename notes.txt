The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box in horizontal writing modes. In vertical writing modes, it sets the width of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements in horizontal writing modes, it specifies the preferred height of line boxes within the element, and on non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.
